### Usage
Most of the buttons, when clicked, will cause a function/operator/value to appear in the input field, allowing you to construct expressions. Clicking the up-arrow by the input field or pressing 'Enter' on a keyboard will evaluate the expression and show the result in the bottom-most row of the display pane above the input field.

The yellow buttons perform various actions:
* 2nd - shows alternate functions in place of the default function buttons
* mode - shows popup, allows toggling of angles as radians vs. degrees, results shown as decimals vs. fractions
* stat - shows popup, allows access to statistical functions
* mat - shows popup, allows access to matrix/vector operations/functions
* ⌫ - deletes all character(s) selected in the input field, or the character directly to the left of the cursor position
* ans - fills the input field with the result of the most recent evaluation
* ↦ - shows popup, assign current contents of input field to a variable name of your choosing
* C - clears all text from the input field
